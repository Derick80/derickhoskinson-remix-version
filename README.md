### scripts

I am trying to do a bunch of automation and one thing is to seed my db AND scan my project for updated content and update the db with the new content.

```Typescript
 "firstSeed": "npx prisma db push && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db seed && tsx scripts/init-seed.ts",
 ```

This should only be run once during the initial dev and production set up.  Using this at any other time will wipe your db. I should add some type of warning!

# zods stf
// This adds type narrowing by the intent property
const Schema = z.discriminatedUnion('intent', [
  z.object({ intent: z.literal('delete'), id: z.string() }),
  z.object({ intent: z.literal('create'), name: z.string() }),
]);

export async function action({ request }: ActionArgs) {
  const data = await zx.parseForm(request, Schema);
  switch (data.intent) {
    case 'delete':
      // data is now narrowed to { intent: 'delete', id: string }
      return;
    case 'create':
      // data is now narrowed to { intent: 'create', name: string }
      return;
    default:
      // data is now narrowed to never. This will error if a case is missing.
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = data;
  }
};

## Getting Started

- use ```openssl rand -hex 32``` to generate a secret key for the .env file

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
