# About Me

I am a Senior Clinical Scientist at a leading healthcare and technology company in Chicago, IL. My expertise lies in human genetics, data analysis, and the integration of big data into modern web applicationsâ€”subjects that keep me passionate and engaged well into the night.

## Education and Experience

I earned my Ph.D. in Genetics from the Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in Boston, MA. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with a robust skill set in:

- **Human Genetics**
- **Inherited Genetics**
- **Cancer Genetics**
- **Genome Builds**
- **Variant Science**
- **Web Technologies**
  - Typescript
  - React
  - R
  - Python
  - ORMs
  - CSS
  - HTML
  - PostgreSQL

## Background

I was born in Western New York State and lived there until I moved to Bolivar, Missouri. In 2001, I relocated to Boston, where I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Massachusetts Boston. I continued my education at the Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and later, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at The Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

After my postdoctoral work, I joined a burgeoning startup, Tempus Labs, leveraging my skills in genomic variant interpretation. Over the past five years, I have broadened my knowledge in genetics and honed my coding abilities. These skills have enabled me to create innovative assays, support automation in production, and streamline various processes.

I am deeply enthusiastic about the future of genetics and web development. I aspire to find a role where I can apply my scientific expertise to enhance data analysis and develop advanced web applications that effectively display and utilize genetic data.
