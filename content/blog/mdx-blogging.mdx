# New MDX Page

## toc


Welcome to your new MDX page. Start editing to add your content!


### Process

- I was having trouble access components from the MDX files. This was due to some misunderstanding of the current working directory and how mdx-bundler works.  So, i started to console.log things

```ts {1,6-10} title="somethingComponent.ts"
const getMDXFileContent = async (slug: string) => {
const basePath = `${process.cwd()}/content/blog/`

  const source = await fsp.readFile(
    path.join(`${basePath}/${slug}.mdx`),
    'utf-8'
  )

  const data = await bundleMDX({
    source,
    cwd: `${process.cwd()}/app/components/ui/`,
    mdxOptions: (options) => ({
      remarkPlugins: [...(options.remarkPlugins ?? []), [remarkGfm]],
      rehypePlugins: [
        ...(options.rehypePlugins ?? []),
        [
          rehypePrettyCode,
          (options = {
            grid: false
          })
        ],
        rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
        rehypeSlug
      ]
    })
  })
  return data
}
```

- I was able to see that the cwd was not what I was expecting.  I was expecting it to be the root of the project, but it was the root of the remix-dh package.  I was able to fix this by setting the cwd to the root of the project.

```ts
/Users/voidnation/Documents/projects/remix-2024/remix-dh/content/blog/ basepath
LOADER root triggered - 2.32 ms
/Users/voidnation/Documents/projects/remix-2024/remix-dh cwd
```
