## Context


While in Japan, I had the opportunity to view some remarkable art installations created by an artist who is not of Japanese origin. Although I am not well-versed in the artist's background beyond the details presented in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haroon_Mirza) article and the exhibit's information panel, I was thoroughly impressed by the exhibit.

The installation itself is particularly noteworthy for its use of vibrations, with the entire display resonating at a consistent frequency. There is also fascinating archaeological evidence that suggests that this frequency may have been used in ancient artifacts, making the exhibit even more intriguing.

```ts

function getImageBuilder (
    id: string,
    alt: string = '',
    { className, style }: { className?: string; style?: CSSProperties } = {},
): ImageBuilder
{
    function imageBuilder (transformations?: TransformerOption) {
        return buildImageUrl(id, { transformations })
    }
    imageBuilder.alt = alt
    imageBuilder.id = id
    imageBuilder.className = className
    imageBuilder.style = style
    return imageBuilder
}

```



This calculator is based on the V3.0 of the ACMG guidelines (Richards et al. 2015). It uses the ACMG criteria from the 2015 publication and incorporates the 2017 updates to the guidelines. Specifically the PM2 criteria was updated to be scored as PM2_Supporting.

This version also uses a modified version of the Bayesian score system from Tavtigian et al. 2020.

The following point values were used for the Bayesian score system to calculate the pathogenicity of a variant:

| Strength      | Point Value |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Very Strong   | 5           |
| Strong        | 4           |
| Moderate      | 2           |
| Supporting    | 3           |
| Indeterminate | 1           |

#### Thresholds

| Pathogenicity     | Point Value |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Pathogenic        | >= 10       |
| Likely Pathogenic | 5-9         |
| Uncertain         | 0- 5        |
| Likely Benign     | -1 - -6     |
| Benign            | > -6        |

### 1.5

### 2.0

This calculator is based on the unreleased V4.0 of the ACMG guidelines.
