## Context


While in Japan, I had the opportunity to view some remarkable art installations created by an artist who is not of Japanese origin. Although I am not well-versed in the artist's background beyond the details presented in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haroon_Mirza) article and the exhibit's information panel, I was thoroughly impressed by the exhibit.

The installation itself is particularly noteworthy for its use of vibrations, with the entire display resonating at a consistent frequency. There is also fascinating archaeological evidence that suggests that this frequency may have been used in ancient artifacts, making the exhibit even more intriguing.
