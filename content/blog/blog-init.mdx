# Welcome to DerickHoskinson.com

I have taken somewhat of a break from coding lately. I am not sure how this will impact my coding projects but for now I will be focusing on getting this site up and running while planning and fiddling a bit with variantAlleles.com app.

## So what's going on here?

I'm a Senior Clinical Scientist with a PhD in Genetics. I work for a large healthcare company where I was hired to build a team of Variant Scientists. [^**] My Post doctorate was busy. I was trained by S. Harrison at the LMM in cambridge MA. I completed my training and dove into variant science.  I did curation for diseases, genes, etc. I classified variants using the 2015 ACMG guidelines, and I overheard (learned?) so many fastinating discussions around patient genetics. [^*] I took this for granted at first but I had the priveledge and pressure of training the first variant scientists who were not PhDs or Genetic Counselours.... pretty cool, right?[^*]

[^*]: No idea if this is really true....
[^**]: I am not sure if I can say the name of the company I work for.  I will have to check on that.
