## Overview

I am building VariantAlleles.com as a way to learn about web development and to provide a useful tool for the genetics community.
I want to build a small community of users who will discuss and provide aid in the interpretation of genetic variants.

## Planning

1. Goals and Objectives
2. Technology Stack

## Technology Stack

### Framework

- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

### Database & ORM & Schema Validation

VariantAlleles.com will use a distributed SQL database that is compatible with postgres to store data. The database is hosted on cockroachlabs cloud.Prisma is used as the ORM. Zod is used for schema validation.

- [CockroachDB](https://cockroachlabs.com)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

### Authentication

VariantAlleles.com will use Clerk for authentication.

- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev)

### Components & Styling

VariantAlleles.com will use ShadUi as the componet library.Shadui uses a headless approach and is integrated with TailwindCss for convienent styling and theming. FramerMotion is used for animations and transitions but has minimal presence in the codebase as I havent focused on animations yet.

I am using the New York icon set from radix-icons. I am also using the lucide icon set for when there is no icon in the radix set.

- [Shadui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [FramerMotion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [radix-icons](https://www.radix-ui.com/icons)
- [lucide-icons](https://lucide.dev/)

### File upload & Storage

The PDF Library will use Cloudinary for file upload and storage.

### Documentation

Im using mdx-bundler to create the posts and pages for VariantAlleles.com.

## Deployment

VariantAlleles.com will be deployed to Fly.io. A previous version of the app was deployed to Netlify but I had trouble updating from Remix V1 to V2. Perhaps I should document that problem and solution here. I discovered that Netlify doesnt support the version of esbuild that mdx-bundler uses. There is probably a work around but I decided to try Fly.io instead.
