## Overview

This document will focus on the planning and implementation of the database for VariantAlleles.com.

## Database & Host

Using CockroachDB as the database for VariantAlleles.com has been useful for development as I test out different application frameworks. I can just place the conncection string in the .env file and the application will connect to the database.

I also used this database for the initial seeding of the app which involved large and complex datasets.

## Consequences
